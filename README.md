# Learning Pandas
A collection of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) based on the  [official Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/). These are meant to help anyone going through the *pandas docs* to conveniently try out the described code examples.


# Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org) is required.
- Familiarity with Python packages (e.g. `venv`, `pip`, `datetime`, [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and even [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) itself) would be advantageous, but is not a must.

# Getting started
First, download the files and create a virtual environment to work in. Then activate the virtual environment.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tim-Abwao/learning-pandas.git
cd learning-pandas
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Afterwards,  install the required modules.

```bash
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Finally, start the notebook server and select a notebook ( *.ipynb file) to run.
```bash
jupyter notebook

```
